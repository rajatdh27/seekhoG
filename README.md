# 🚀 seekhoG — Learn DSA, Backend & Programming Concepts

**seekhoG** is a learning platform I built to help developers **understand core computer science concepts deeply**, instead of just memorizing solutions.

The focus is on **clear explanations, visual understanding, and practical relevance** — making it easier to learn, revise, and prepare for interviews.
